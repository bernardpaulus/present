Website to track who was when in your sports club


I started this project to track who was there when at the lessons of my local
[Yoseikan Budo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoseikan_budo) club.

The intent is first to record attendance to the lessons, then track membership
and fees status.


Trivia
------

The name comes both from "to be present" and from present, as gift, as I intend
to make this site a present to my club.

Also, this reflect my state of mind of trying to live more in the now.


People, I like you!
